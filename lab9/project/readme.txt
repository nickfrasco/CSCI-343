A comparison of LCS and Edit Distance

How to use the programs:
LCS.java: this program is run through the command line. You have to put the commands:
	- javac LCS.java
	- java LCS "whatever input file you want to run"
Edit_Distance.java: this program gives you a command prompt asking which file you'd like to test.

The outputs:
LCS.java: Will output the length of LCS (and info) into a .txt file called "answers.txt" (can be changed to whatever output is desired)
Edit_Distance.java: Will output edit distance between 2 concurring strands. (minimum number of moves to make into next strand)

Conclusion:
